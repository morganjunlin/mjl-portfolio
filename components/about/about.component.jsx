            Hey there, Morgan here! I'm a full-stack software engineer that's driven by the sheer desire to help people solve problems. My passion is to remain up-to-date with current trends, and learn the latest technology to polish my existing skills to further improve my craft.
          </p>

            My current tech-related interest is, and has been for the last decade, in the evolution of smartphones and our interactions with them. For instance, I am extremely fascinated with FinTechâ€™s growth and its relation and use-cases with smartphones. It is incredible to witness how far we have come ever since the release of the first iPhone, and how we, as a society, adapt and grow as technological innovations continue to revolutionize the industry. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not thinking about tech, things I like to do for fun and leisure is exploring the outside world by taking photographs, eating delicious foods at new restaurants, socializing with pals, or occasionally playing video games.
